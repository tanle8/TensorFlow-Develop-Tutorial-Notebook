# Getting Started

For a brief overview of TensorFlow programming fundamentals, see the following guide:

Getting Started with TensorFlow
MNIST has become the canonical dataset for trying out a new machine learning toolkit. We offer three guides that each demonstrate a different approach to training an MNIST model on TensorFlow:

MNIST for ML Beginners, which introduces MNIST through the high-level API.
Deep MNIST for Experts, which is more-in depth than "MNIST for ML Beginners," and assumes some familiarity with machine learning concepts.
TensorFlow Mechanics 101, which introduces MNIST through the low-level API.
For developers new to TensorFlow, the high-level API is a good place to start. To learn about the high-level API, read the following guides:

tf.estimator Quickstart, which introduces this API.
Building Input Functions, which takes you into a somewhat more sophisticated use of this API.
TensorBoard is a utility to visualize different aspects of machine learning. The following guides explain how to use TensorBoard:

TensorBoard: Visualizing Learning, which gets you started.
TensorBoard: Graph Visualization, which explains how to visualize the computational graph. Graph visualization is typically more useful for programmers using the low-level API.
